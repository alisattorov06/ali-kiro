# FlowDeck

> Structured planning and execution workflows for OpenCode

FlowDeck structures every feature through an **adaptive workflow cycle**. The orchestrator scores each task and selects the minimal sufficient workflow class dynamically.

## Features

- **12 agents** — orchestrator, planner, architect, backend-coder, frontend-coder, devops, mapper, tester, reviewer, researcher, security-auditor, debug-specialist
- **42 skills** — reusable workflow patterns (TDD, security scan, code review, planning, and more)
- **8 commands** — slash-command entry points for the task pipeline: `/fd-task`, `/fd-review`, `/fd-execute`, `/fd-verify`, `/fd-done`, with `/fd-checkpoint`, `/fd-resume`, `/fd-status` for support
- **Adaptive workflow routing** — scores tasks across 5 dimensions and selects the minimal sufficient workflow class
- **Persistent state** — resume exactly where you left off across sessions via `~/.fd-plan/<slug>/STATE.md` and `~/.fd-plan/<slug>/checkpoint.json`
- **Parallel execution** — independent tasks run simultaneously through the orchestrator
- **AI safety scaffolding** — patch trust scoring, edit gates, phase gating, and regression prediction built into selected workflows
- **FDX CLI** — 16 token-optimized Rust tools: `fdx-context`, `fdx-decisions`, `fdx-validate`, `fdx-worktree`, `fdx-read`, `fdx-search`, `fdx-grep`, `fdx-batch`, `fdx-impact`, `fdx-outline`, `fdx-diff`, `fdx-git`, `fdx-ls`, `fdx-tree`, `fdx-test`, `fdx-lint`
- **MCP-aware integrations** — uses codegraph, Exa (web search), Grep.app, Context7, and token-optimizer MCPs when registered

## Quick Reference

### Pipeline commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/fd-task` | Auto-init `~/.fd-plan/<slug>/`, map the codebase, confirm requirements, and save `task.md`, `architecture.md`, `affect.md`, `plan.md` |
| `/fd-review` | Two-lens review (CEO + engineering) of the task artifacts before execution |
| `/fd-execute` | Implement `plan.md` with the TDD pipeline — parallel worktree guard from `affect.md`, wave-based execution, checkpoint after each wave |
| `/fd-verify` | Run tests, regression-check `affect.md` files, code review, security scan; blocks `/fd-done` on failure |
| `/fd-done` | Summarize built vs required, then commit and push on confirmation |

### Support commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/fd-checkpoint` | Force-save session state to `checkpoint.json` and `STATE.md` (normally automatic on `session.idle`) |
| `/fd-resume` | Restore `checkpoint.json` (falling back to `STATE.md`), PAUSE for confirmation, continue the recorded command and stage |
| `/fd-status` | Show the current pipeline stage, artifact status, and blockers for the active topic |
